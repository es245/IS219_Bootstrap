I've always been interested in the way web pages, programs, games, and even how computers work. From a young age, I've always been a techno-centric person, keeping up with new technologies and the latest tech products of anything from smart phones, personal computers, the modern internet, and much more. For the past few years, I've made it my mission to become familiarized with new and old web technologies, the latest design trends and patterns, and try to hone my skills as a developer and designer.</p>

          <h4 class="body-text">Back in the day, when Myspace was a thing, I was the self-proclaimed expert of styling my profile. All my friends would ask me to help them pimp their pages as well: adding a music player to thier profile, changing the background to an image instead of a color, and even how to change their top 8 into their top 20. It's been a long time since then, however, I never really lost interest in the way I was able to make my page look. I took those same, admittedly ameteur skills, and I tried to add onto them, leading me on my journey into front-end development and web design. </h4>

          <h4 class="body-text align-right">I was one of those kids that knew what they wanted to do when they grew up early on. I knew I wanted to create, design, build, and bring to life my own creations. Albeit, I could have been a engineer or carpenter and still achieved my goals, but I was preoccupied with what one might consider a mild obsession with code. Ever since my high school web design basics class, I knew that was what I wanted to do, to code. Whether it's browsing around reddit on r/webdesign or r/programmerhumor, drooling and staring in awe at the amazing portfolios on behance, or going on css-tricks or medium.com to find out the latest css hack, I always find a way stay in touch with that world which has become a part of who I am, and I a part of it.</h4>

          <h4 class="body-text">At some point, every student is going to become fed up with all the theory, and demand the practice. If those students are as eager and impatient as me, they'll have went ahead of the class, skipped a few chapters, and, like myself, tried to learn more on their own. The beautiful thing about programming, I believe, is how easy it is to practice. Whether I'm trying out some sass variables and methods, testing my PHP code in XAMPP, or trying to install the latest Drupal module, every tool I'll ever need is easily available to me. Some of the tools I use, but are not limited to, are: XAMPP, PHPMyAdmin, Atom.io, Vim, Sass, Jade, and of course, Chrome.</h4>
